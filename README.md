# Aptos-DaoSwap

Build the best NFT community with DaoSwap


# What is DaoSwap?

TL;DR answer: <br />
DaoSwap is a candy machine (NFT launch tool) with an NFT swap liquidity pool inspired by SudoSwap <br />

DaoSwap is an NFT launch tool that plans to solve 3 current NFT community problems

## 1. centralized fund management
When community fund goes directly to the deployer's wallet, the project can be easily rugged by some malicious creators.<br />
Instead in Daoswap, NFT sales and rarity fund will be held in a swap pool as a buyback guarantee.<br />
Holders will always have exit liquidity and the exit price will gradually go up when more holders come in and more project incomes get generated.<br />
Project deployers can design how they get paid (weekly paid from the pool or paid based on volume/floor price, etc.)<br />
Transparent, decentralized, smart contract guarded and beautiful way of fund management:)<br />

## 2. weak incentives for early stakeholders
Currently, early stakeholders can only get OGs/WLs and wait a long time before the final mint.<br />
This is tedious and boring!<br />
In Daoswap, early stakeholders can get their NFTs from day 1.<br />
With more people knowing and buying the project's NFTs, the exit price will rise.<br />
Quick profits for degen flippers and instant feedback for diamond hands.<br />

## 3. too much focus on marketing, too little on building
In the bear market, the biggest challenge for an NFT project is attracting enough launch minters.<br />
If the launch performs very badly, the project will face a sudden death.<br />
As a result, projects nowadays are focusing too much on marketing and gathering people.<br />
Projects often don't build anything before sold-out and are not incentivized to build more because of sold-out.<br />
Sad results come, like a rug or a soft-rug.<br />
In Daoswap, there's no pressure of sold-out.<br />
Projects can sell nfts from day 1, and the more you build, the more buyers come, then the better exit price for early holders.<br />
Make your project in a more linear and manageable way.<br />
